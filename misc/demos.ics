DESCRIPTION:Happy Friday! We end each week with demos. It’s casual—a chance
  to share each other’s work with the broader product team and celebrate mil
 estones—and timed to bleed into cocktail hour in the New York office. Demos
  can range from design mocks and prototypes to new features and products th
 at are ready to ship\, as well as personal side projects or anything else t
 hat might be of interest to the rest of the team. The product managers help
  organize this (and let you know ahead of time!)\, but the demos will be gi
 ven by whoever worked on the project. And anyone should certainly feel free
  to propose a demo for any particular Friday.
